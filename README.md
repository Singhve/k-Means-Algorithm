# k-Means-Algorithm
Implementing k-Means algorithm for clustering

Implement k-Means algorithm for clustering. The program should take a comma-separated data Ô¨Åle, and the number of clusters(k-value) as command line parameters. There is one optional parameter, which is another Ô¨Ålename which lists the id of initial centroids. For example, without the optional parameter, we may run your program (mykMeans) as below:

./mykMeans datafile.txt 3

In that case, it should cluster the data points in datafile.txt into 3 clusters. The data Ô¨Åle datafile.txt lists one data point in each line. The values of a data points along diÔ¨Äerent dimensions are separated by a comma. No id is given for a data point, but you must assume that the id of a data point is the same as its line number in the input Ô¨Åle assuming that the line numbering starts from 1. For initial centroid you should use k random data points.

Now, with the optional parameter, we can also run your program as below:

./mykMeans datafile.txt 5 centroidfile.txt

Say, the centroidfile.txt contains the following integers for a clustering task with k=5:
1
5 
19 
201 
371 
390

In that case you must use the points with id 5,19,201,371,and 390 as your initial centroids. For all cases, use  = 0.0001 as your stopping condition.

The program output should consists of the following information:
1. The number of data points in the input Ô¨Åle, the dimension, and the value of k 
2. The number of iterations the program took for convergence 
3. The Ô¨Ånal mean of each cluster and the SSE score (sum of square error) 
4. The Ô¨Ånal cluster assignment of all the points. 
5. The Ô¨Ånal size of each cluster.

Execute your program on the iris.txt dataset. Run it for at least 10 times with diÔ¨Äerent random initializations of centroid (make sure to randomize your random seeds so that diÔ¨Äerent runs of the program starts with a diÔ¨Äerent random set of centroids). Now, evaluate the clustering using purity-based evaluation and report the best purity score. Note that for purity based evaluation you need to know the true label of a data points. Here is the true label assignments on the iris.txt dataset: 1-50: class 1, 51-100: class 2, and 101-150: class 3.
